This workshop will guide you through only the elements of copyright laws you will need to know, provide a custom search engine for scanning archival resources and introduce you to research strategies for sourcing obscure, copyright free media and identify the license of media you don't know the status of. 

### About the Author

This workshop is based on my experience working as the Digital Media Editor for Washington State history site, [HistoryLink](https://historylink.org/), before coming to the University of Idaho as the Digital Initiatives Librarian. The position required helping written and oral historians source material that would strengthen their articles and survey the visual resources of the entire site to improve its accessibility.
