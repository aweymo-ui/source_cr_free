Incorporating images, video and audio into your research can help add context, make concepts more relatable and findings more intuitive. At the same time, machine learning and reverse image searching has made identifying copyright protected material easier than ever before, which can cost you hours of reworking material or monetary damage. Understanding basic copyright laws and advanced digital research strategies can help protect you from these elements and enrich your work.
