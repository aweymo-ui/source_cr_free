## Creative Commons

Both our [U of I Library Copyright Guide](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/copyright/guide.html) and the [Cornell Libguide](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain) are excellent, thorough resources but I will give a summarized version of issues you will most likely to encounter in this process. First off, items can be made available by any on of the [six creative commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/). This [License Chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) module created by the Creative Commons is helpful in understanding why people choose the different variations you'll encounter during research.

## Public Domain

Things become quite complicated regarding when things are _not in public domain_, so let's begin with media that are. These include:
* Any item published before 1929 regardless of copyright status (1924 for sound recordings)
* Any item published without a copyright notice between 1929-1977
* Any item published without a copyright notice and subsequent registration within 5 years of expiration from 1978-1989
* Any item published with notice but copyright was not renewed, 1929-1963
* Any item prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties
* For the most part, any item published outside the United States before 1978

> The situation you will encounter most for items that were published _with a copyright notice_ from 1929-1977 is that they become public domain 95 years after their publication date. 

> As of the time of this writing, this just happened with Mickey Mouse, who was originally created in 1928 and can now be recreated by anyone, anywhere, without permission of the Disney company, including myself.
