## Creative Commons

While our [U of I Library Copyright Guide](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/copyright/guide.html) and the [Cornell Libguide](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  are excellent, thorough resources, my goal here is to provide an abridged version of issues you will most likely to encounter sourcing copyright free media to compliment your research. 

First off, items can be made available by any one of the [six creative commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} . This [License Chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  module created by the Creative Commons is helpful in understanding why people choose the different variations you'll encounter during research.

## Public Domain

Things become quite complicated regarding media that is not in public domain, so let's begin with media that <red>is in the public domain</red>. These include:
* Any item published before 1929 regardless of copyright status (1924 for sound recordings)
* Any item published without a copyright notice between 1929-1977
* Any item published without a copyright notice and subsequent registration within 5 years of expiration from 1978-1989
* Any item published with notice but copyright was not renewed, 1929-1963
* Any item prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties
* _For the most part_, any item published outside the United States before 1978

Relating to the first point, any item _with a copyright notice_ , whose _copyright has been renewed_ still becomes public domain 95 years after their publication date. 

{% include figure.html img="mickey.jpg" alt="Walt Disney holding a three dimensional cut out of Mickey Mouse" caption="Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse, October 1931, under public domain because the periodical that published the work did not renew their copyright." width="75%" %}

When this workshop was originally created in Winter of 2024, this had just happened with Mickey Mouse in 1928's _Steamboat Willie_ and can now be recreated by anyone, anywhere, without permission of the Disney corporation. But keep in mind, this applies only to this _specific work_ and not _the character Mickey Mouse_ more generally.
