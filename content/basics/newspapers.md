The advent of digital newspaper collection has made a massive amount of publicly accessible but not necessarily available to use. In addition to everything before 1929 being public domain, if a newspaper **never filed a copyright claim between 1923 through 1977** or **never renewed a copyright from 1923 to 1963**, the item is public domain. 

This sounds complicated, but thanks to copyright records that have been digitized and run through optical character recognition, this process is more manageable than ever.

1. Figure out the date that the newspaper started, which any major search engine should be able to provide
2. Look up the year (and maybe a few years afterwards to be safe) in the [Catalog of Copyright Entries](https://archive.org/details/copyrightrecords&tab=about) in the Internet Archive, which spans 1891-1977 search the [text for your newspaper title](https://archive.org/search?query=mediatype%3A%28texts%29+AND+contributor%3A%28%28United+States+Copyright+Office%29%29+1923+Catalog+of+Copyright+Entries%2C+Part+2%2C&sort=-date). If you don't find your title, it is public domain. If you do, go to step three -- 
3. Third, depending on the date that the license was obtained, check the [Catalog of Copyright Entries](https://archive.org/details/copyrightrecords&tab=about) or the Library of Congress' [Copyright Public Records System](https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Indianapolis+Times&Search_Code=TALL&PID=6TUmlnaBcwg0zFtT97LZZSNB8ZiP&SEQ=20240102144432&CNT=25&HIST=1) (spanning 1978-present)  [28 years](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html) afterwards. If you don't find a record for it within five years that the license expired, it is public domain. If they did, **the item will become public domain 95 years after the date it was originally published.**
