__Utilizing digitized historic newspapers can provide candid insights into research subjects and important context to research projects.__ The advent of digital newspaper collections over the last twenty years has made a massive amount of material publicly accessible but not necessarily available to use. 

In addition to everything before 1929 being public domain, if a newspaper <red>never filed a copyright claim between 1923 through 1977</red> or <red>never renewed a copyright from 1923 to 1963</red>, the item is no longer copyright protected. 

While identifying the copyright status of newspapers was incredibly difficult, digitization has made this process more manageable and efficient than ever. The method I will detail below is taken from the [best practices of Hoosier State Chronicles](https://blog.newspapers.library.in.gov/fair-use-and-copyright-research/) that they use to select various Indiana State newspapers for digitization. That said, this method __is not flawless__ but it will give you a better understanding of the copyright status of the material and demonstrate due diligence on your part.

## How to Check Newspaper Copyright

Using the newspaper The Seattle Star as an example, 
1. Figure out the date that the newspaper started, which any major search engine should be able to provide
2. [Look up the year](https://archive.org/search?query=mediatype%3A%28texts%29+AND+contributor%3A%28%28United+States+Copyright+Office%29%29+1923+Catalog+of+Copyright+Entries%2C+Part+2%2C&sort=-date) (and maybe a few years afterwards to be safe) in the [Catalog of Copyright Entries](https://archive.org/details/copyrightrecords&tab=about) in the Internet Archive (spanning 1891-1977)  and [search the text](https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyri182libr/page/n7/mode/2up?q=%22West+Seattle+Herald%22) for your newspaper title. If you don't find your title, it is most likely public domain. If you do, proceed to step three -- 
3. Third, depending on the date that the license was obtained, check the [Catalog of Copyright Entries](https://archive.org/details/copyrightrecords&tab=about) or the Library of Congress' [Copyright Public Records System](https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Indianapolis+Times&Search_Code=TALL&PID=6TUmlnaBcwg0zFtT97LZZSNB8ZiP&SEQ=20240102144432&CNT=25&HIST=1) (spanning 1978-present)  [28 years](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html) afterwards. If you don't find a record for it within five years that the license expired, it is public domain. If they did renew their copyright, <red>the item will still become public domain 95 years after the date it was originally published.</red>
