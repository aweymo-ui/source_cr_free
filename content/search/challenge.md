**Let's spend a very small amount of time** implementing the search resources, copyright knowledge and search strategies this workshop has covered.

Returning to Moscow, Idaho native and University of Idaho and Washington basketball coach Clarence Sinclair "Hec" Edmundson, let's spend five minutes attempting to find __the earliest photograph of this person__, keeping in mind:

- Edmundson was born in Moscow in 1888 and spent his entire youth in Idaho
- He graduated from the University of Idaho in 1910 and coached there from 1916-1918
- He competed in the 1912 Olympics running track
- He coached at the University of Washington starting in 1920

Now spend five minutes trying to find the earliest photograph of Hec, using the `Search Resources` and `How To Use These Resources` sections of this site. Think about the geographic and chronological areas that this photograph would most likely be, and how you can structure your search phrases to filter results. My findings are hidden below. **Good luck!**

## How did I get there?

Working broadly, I saw that there some of the most widely distributed early photos are from the [1912 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hec_Edmundson#/media/File:1912_Athletics_men's_800_metre_final.JPG). Because of this, I knew I only needed to seek out resources focusing on Idaho state since Edmundson moved to Washington much later. I had a hunch that the subject would be in his 1910 graduating class yearbook for the U of I, which I found through our [Gem of the Mountain Yearbook Collection](https://archive.org/details/uidaho_gem_1910/page/148/mode/2up?q=edmundson&view=theater). Finally, I searched NewsBank, Newspapers.com and the Library of Congress Newspapers for earlier photos, filtering dates between 1890 and 1910, in the state of Idaho and alternating searches between `Clarence Sinclair Edmundson`, `Clarence S. Edmundson` and `Hec Edmundson` and was able to find a couple photos from 1909. Drilling down into `regional archive examples,` I was able to locate the above image.  And, as this newspaper was printed well before 1929, we are free to use this public domain image in our research.
