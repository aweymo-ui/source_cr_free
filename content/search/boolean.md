Boolean operators are a database logic you can use to refine your searches. The most basic elements are using `AND, OR and NOT(or"-")` between keywords or putting `quotes` around your phrases to use an exact phrase and `parenthesis` when using multiple operators in the same line. Helpful Google (and Google Scholar) operators include `site: (and -site)` to include or exclude results from specific sites and `AROUND(#)` to produce results where your two keywords on either side are within a certain number of words with each other.
