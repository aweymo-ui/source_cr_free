__On a past project__, I was trying to find a photo of a [Filipino cannery worker](https://maritimewa.org/story/through-a-filipino-lens-washington-state-cannery-workers-in-alaska/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that traveled between San Francisco and Alaska in the 1920s and 30s. I found that `Salvador Caballero` was listed in newspapers, union periodicals and archival records alternately as `S. Caballero, Sal Caballero and Salvatore Caballero`. Older documents will often add a middle initial to a name and sometimes abbreviate first names in ways we don't often see anymore. For example, Geo. for George, Abig. for Abigail and Chas. for Charles, pop up frequently in historic newspapers and books. This [Wiktionary list](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Abbreviations_for_English_given_names){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of English name abbreviations is a handy reference if you encounter this.

The University of Idaho's [Taylor Wilderness Research Station](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/taylor-wilderness-research-station){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was previously Taylor Ranch. The town of [Tensed, ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensed,_Idaho){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was originally named De Smet after a Belgian missionary, reversed and misspelled at the post office. As of 2022, the US Department of Interior renamed [71 natural areas](https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/interior-department-votes-to-rename-geographic-places-in-idaho-that-included-ethnic-slur-for-indigenous-women/#:~:text=In%20Idaho%2C%20the%20changes%20included,Naokwaide%20and%20Newe%20Waippe%20Naokwaide.){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} around Idaho that had derogatory names. 

__The names of buildings, cities and natural resources can shift colloquially over time or over night__. If you find a strange gaps in search results, try zooming out and searching more encyclopedic sources like Wikipedia or [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to check for semantic shifts.
