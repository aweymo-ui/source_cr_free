title: How to Use These Resources
---

The following module is a list of resources you can use to find images, audio and video material, working broadly and then drilling down into smaller, more detailed resources. Using the filter on the right hand side of the following module, you can pinpoint repositories that will be most helpful for you. These include filtering by format (`images, audio and video`) as well as by repository type, which include:

- `Broad`: Major search engines
- `Consortiums`: Essentially collections of collections
- `Large Archival Institutions`
- `International Consortiums`: Resources outside of the United States
- `Newspapers`: All accessible to University of Idaho students and faculty
- `Books and Journals`: An underutilized resource for finding illustrations and engravings of figures before 1900

__Where available, copyright search features have already been configured.__
