title: How to Use These Resources
---

The following module is a list of resources you can use to find media, working broadly and then drilling down into smaller, more detailed resources. Using the filter on the left hand side of the following module, you can pinpoint repositories that will be most helpful for you. These include filtering by format (`images, audio and video`) as well as by repository type, which include:

- `Broad`: Major search engines with copyright filters configured
- `Consortiums`: Essentially collections of collections and very large archival institutions
- `International Consortiums`: Mostly english speaking consortiums
- `Newspapers`: All accessible for University of Idaho students and faculty
- `Books and Journals`: An underutilized resource for finding illustrations and engravings of figures before 1900
- `Regional Archive Examples`: Intended to get you thinking about niche, regional digital collections you might look for depending on your subject.
