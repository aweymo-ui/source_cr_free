## Fair Use

But does any of this matter when you can claim you are using copyright protected material in _fair use_? According to the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/), fair use is the "legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances." These special circumstances include the “purpose and character of the use” particularly when using for non-profit and/or educational purposes. 

> That said, arguing the case that you are using an item in this way is expensive enough to ward many away from attempting to do so. In my work, I've never needed to use a copyright protected image under fair use aside from a handful of times it was requested directly by the founders, who understood the liabilities.

## Attribution

Even though only some Creative Common licenses require attribution, it will be helpful to you as a researcher to give full attributions for all of your work. Providing a **title, author, source** (including archival catalog number if applicable) and **license** of the work will ultimately improve your records, dissuade infringement claims and help readers find the media sources independently if they are interested.

## Takedown Requests

Unable to identify the copyright status of an item you would like to use and the risk of the material type seems low? Creating a simple takedown notice request section in your research gives potential copyright owners a way to contact you directly to avoid legal complications.

## Version Copyright

Lastly, you may encounter images which should be in public domain but are claimed by stock photography giants such as Getty Images or AP News to be under their copyright. This is because these companies have copyright over a **particular print, version or photograph** of the public domain work.


> One example is the _Mona Lisa_, which is public domain because Leonardo da Vinci died more than 70 years ago. Getty would like to sell you [this photograph](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/mona-lisa-also-called-la-gioconda-or-la-joconde-c1503-1506-news-photo/113493446?adppopup=true) of the painting for $500 or you can choose to use [this photograph](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mona_Lisa_-_the_Louvre.jpg) for free, because the person who took it also made it publicly available. This is another place where good record keeping and proper attribution will pay off. As long as you can point to a copyright free version you sourced the media from, you are protected from this threat.
